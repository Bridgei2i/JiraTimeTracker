JFreeCharts
		   JFreeChart is a free 100% Java chart library that makes it easy for developers to display professional quality charts in their applications. 
	JFreeChart's extensive feature set includes:
	a consistent and well-documented API, supporting a wide range of chart types;
	a flexible design that is easy to extend, and targets both server-side and client-side applications;
	support for many output types, including Swing and JavaFX components, image files (including PNG and JPEG), and vector graphics file formats (including PDF, EPS and SVG);
	JFreeChart is open source or, more specifically, free software. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL), which permits use in proprietary applications.
	JfreeChart is an open source library developed in Java, which can be used within Java based applications to create a wide range of charts. By using JFreeChart, we can create all the major type of 2D and 3D charts such as pie chart, bar chart, line chart, XY chart and 3D charts.
	It comes with well documented APIs, which makes it quite easy to understand.

It supports a wide range of chart types such as Pie Chart, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Area Chart and time series chart, Bubble chat in 2D and 3D.

JFreeChart is easy to extend and can be used in both, the client-side, as well as the server-side applications.

It supports multiple output formats like PNG, JPEG, PDF, SVG etc.

It allows extensive customizations of charts from font size of legends to caption on mouse hover.

the quality of charts are fine, the input data is to be created as class objects..

the customizations creates little overhead to the implemenataion
	
JCCKIT
	is for  scientific data visualization.
OpenChart2
	Openchart2 is a simple, open-source charting and plotting library designed for incorporation with a variety of Java applications.  The library can generate two dimensional bar, pie, radar, and scatter charts with customized titles, axis labels, legends and colors.  The simplicity of the library is its strongest feature, and developers will be met with a shallow learning curve.
	Features

	Openchart2 is a lightweight charting solution that can provide generation of several chart types.  This library provides a simple charting interface with the standard assortment of chart annotations.  Openchart2 can render the following chart types:
	Bar Charts (including Stacked Bar Charts)
	Pie Charts
	Radar Charts
	Scatter Plots (including Line Charts, Point Charts, or a combination)
	The underlying engine for performing chart rendering has been designed for easy inclusion into a range of application types, including web applets and Swing desktop applications.  Openchart2 does trade some eye-candy operations for simplicity, allowing the developer to quickly and seamlessly generate and integrate dynamic charts and plots into his or her software.  Openchart2's liberal licensing and free documentation make development worry-free.
	Simple to use....
	its not providing many types of graphs...
	very minimal customization is available...
Jcharts
		Useful charting component which supports many types of charts like Area
	Area Stacked
	Bar
	Bar Clustered
	Bar Clustered Horizontal
	Bar Horizontal
	Bar Stacked
	Bar Stacked Horizontal
	Combo
	Hi/Low Open/Close
	Line
	Pie 2D
	Pie 3D (current CVS)
	Point
	Radar (current CVS)
	XY Plot
	the quality of the charts are comparitively good and it supports radar charts..
	Charts exports to the following formats: PNG, JPEG, and SVG, via encoder objects located in the org.krysalis.jcharts.encoders package. Each of these encoders has a method to encode your charts:
	offers good amount of customization by which you can decide how your legends look like.. how your title should be showed... 
	and you can decide the values to be shown in the graph.. you can show currency.. you can set axis size and position and fonts..
	the quality is overall good..

Jzy3D


Jzy3d is an open source java library that allows to easily draw 3d scientific data: surfaces, scatter plots, bar charts, and lot of other 3d primitives. The API provides support for rich interactive charts, with colorbars, tooltips and overlays. Axis and chart layout can be fully customized and enhanced.

Relying on JOGL 2, you can easily deploy native OpenGL charts on Windows, Unix, MacOs (...) and integrate into Swing, AWT, or SWT. Various contributions have also made Jzy3d available for other languages/platforms such as Scala, Groovy, and Matlab.

The API can be used freely in commercial applications. You can download and try the API samples. A tutorial shows how to display scatters and surfaces. An extended developper guide with many code examples is also available.
